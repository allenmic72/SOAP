NEU Mobile App Development semester project, produced by Michael Allen and James Hardy.

This app allows a user to easily keep track of their handwashing practices every day. The user sets up a time schedule for the app to run in the background (Example Mon-Fri 9am - 5pm). When the app is running during this time, the user simply has to tap their phone is the set pattern to register a handwashing event. The pattern is as follows: Two solid taps to the front or back of the phone, after which the phone will vibrate. One more solid tap for confirmation and you're all set.

We recieved the runner-up award for best app at the end of the semester, competing against undergrads and grad students.
